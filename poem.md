# Holy Cosmos
**_Nathalie Handal_**

:last_quarter_moon_with_face: :star: :first_quarter_moon_with_face:
- **Weâ€™ve been told space
is like two dark lips colliding**

   - _like science fiction
it outlines a small cosmos_

 - **where fear hides in a glow
where negative space**

   - _becomes a place for wishing
a constellation of hazy tunes_

 - **of faint sharp vowels
a glossary of meteors**

   - _a telescope to god
a cold bright white_

 - **maybe distance damages us
maybe Jupiter**

   - _will suddenly surprise us
with a notion of holiness_

 - **but instead an old planet
takes over all the space**

   - _and we are reminded
of the traces of fire_

 - **in our gaze
defining our infidelities**
